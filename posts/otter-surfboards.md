## James Otter and his company Otter Surfboards craft hollow wooden surfboards – a beautiful, environmentally-friendly and long-lasting alternative to typical surfboards – and invite surfers down to their workshop in Cornwall, UK, to build their own wooden board on one of their workshop weeks. We visit James to learn about his journey as a craftsperson and his approach to creative entrepreneurship.

James, or “Jim” or “Jimmy”, as he happily goes by, emerges from his workshop, its huge bright blue barn-style doors slid wide open, welcoming in the sunshine. He’s barefooted, as always. Wearing an earnest and spirited smile, he extends his arms and suddenly I’m engulfed in his embrace. “He’s a hugger”, smiles Liz, James’ wife, who appears, equally exuberant, with the newest member of the Otter family strapped to her chest: little, doe-eyed, cheerful chappy, William. As if in the company of old friends, we easily slip into comfortable conversation punctuated with laughter. The mood fits the morning – it’s the beginning of a bright, sunny day.<br>

Perched a stone’s throw – just over a kilometre – from the Cornish coast, where countryside rolls over sea cliffs into the ocean, the Otter Surfboards workshop is sited alongside other young businesses on a small ecological park. The journey to the workshop offers tantalising glimpses of the hazy blue smudge that lies on the horizon; the fresh sea breeze rustles the gorse and its radiant yellow flowers; and birds flit in and out of the hedgerows that line the dusty lanes dissecting the countryside.

n the workshop, the sun stirs up a warm woody aroma. It’s like Aladdin’s cave for woodworkers; saws, files, clamps, mallets, planes and all kinds of hand tools hang from the white-washed walls. Towards the back, a small wall coated in blackboard paint is chalked up with scrawled drawings, notes, measurements and angles alongside the emblazoned all-CAPS statement “MEASURE TWICE”. On the opposite wall, hand painted in script-style writing reads, less assertively, “Cut Once”. Lined up against the rear wall, in the shadowy recess of the space, is a collection of wooden boards, each different in shape or style. James gently pulls a few from the rack exhibiting his work and that of his workshop attendees. It's incredible to think that the raw planks of cedar and poplar laid outside the workshop will also end up as such impressive works of craftsmanship.<br>

James sets back to work, whistling as he goes. James and Liz’s black Labrador, Buddy, patrols the workshop, tail wagging, with an old tennis ball in his mouth, its lime green, slobbery threads dangling down and the brown inner exposed. The workshop falls silent as James slips into a state of concentration, templating the nose of the board, marking it out in pencil, measuring twice, of course, and then slowly cutting into the wood with a kataba, a Japanese pull saw. He moves on to planing, purposefully gliding the tool across the wood, creating perfect ringlets of shavings that find their way to the floor. He pauses intermittently and gently runs his hand along the board’s edge to assess his work.
